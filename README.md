<!-- ### üè† [Homepage](homepage) -->

<!-- ### ‚ú® [Demo](demo) -->

## Prerequisites

- npm >= 8.1.2
- node >= 16.13.1

## Install

Install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

As a second step the dev environment must be set. To do the process a bit easier, you can run the command

```sh
npm start init
```

Please update the firebase and the microsoft parameters.

```js
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  versionNumber: 'v2.0.0',
  prefix: 'T-',
  // Firebase Config
  firebase: {
    apiKey: '',
    authDomain: '',
    databaseURL: '',
    projectId: '',
    storageBucket: '',
    messagingSenderId: '',
    appId: '',
    measurementId: '',
  },
  globals: {
    team1: 0,
    team2: 1,
    round1: 0,
    round2: 1,
    round3: 2,
  },
  // MS Auth
  ms: {
    tenant: '',
  },
};
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

## Run the Local Emulator Suite

Instead of using your Firebase backend, you can use Emulators that run locally.

### Install the Local Emulator Suite

To install the Emulator Suite, run this command

```sh
firebase init emulators
```

and choose the Emulators you need.

### Configure the Emulator Suite

If you want to use different ports, you can rerun `firebase init emulators` or edit the
`firebase.json` file. To change the paths to the Security Rules, you can also edit the
`firebase.json` file.

Without configuration, the emulators will use the default ports and run with open data security.

### Connecting the App to the Emulator

In the file `app.module.ts` you have to set the ports for the connections to the ports of the Emulator.
You also have to add the `useEmulators` property and set it to `true` in `environment.ts`.
You can set the `prefix` property to an empty string when using the emulator for Firestore,
because it won't affect the data in production.

```js
export const environment = {
  useEmulators: true,
  production: false,
  versionNumber: 'v2.0.0',
  prefix: '',
  // Firebase Config
  firebase: {
    apiKey: '',
    authDomain: '',
    databaseURL: '',
    projectId: '',
    storageBucket: '',
    messagingSenderId: '',
    appId: '',
    measurementId: '',
  },
  globals: {
    team1: 0,
    team2: 1,
    round1: 0,
    round2: 1,
    round3: 2,
  },
  // MS Auth
  ms: {
    tenant: '',
  },
};
```

If you use the Emulator for the database, you must set the `databaseURL` to URL of the Emulator,
which you can retrieve from the terminal while the emulator is running.

### Starting the Emulators

To start the Emulators, run this command.

```sh
firebase emulators:start
```

To import data into the emulator that you have previously exported, you can run this command.

```
firebase emulators:start --import <path-to-directory>
```

### Import Production Data to the Local Emulator

To import production data to the Local Emulator you have to export the data first. Follow these
instructions to export your data:

1. Login to Firebase and Google Cloud:
   ```
   firebase login
   gcloud auth login
   ```
2. List your projects and connect to the project you want to export:

   ```
   firebase projects:list
   firebase use your-project-name

   gcloud projects list
   gcloud config set project your-project-name
   ```

3. Export the production data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, providing a name for the folder:
   ```
   gcloud firestore export gs://your-project-name.appspot.com/your-choosen-folder-name
   ```
4. Copy this folder to your local machine:
   ```
   gsutil -m cp -r gs://your-project-name.appspot.com/your-choosen-folder-name .
   ```

Now you run the Emulator with the exported production data using the command mentioned above.

## Linting

With prettier, eslint and husky we set up the linting process.
To check linting manuel, you can use this command

```sh
npm run p:check
npm run p:write
```

<!--
## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
